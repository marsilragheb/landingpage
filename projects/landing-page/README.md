## NavigationBar
```
I have built a navigation bar with an unorderd list with dynamic list items added according to sections number .
The navigation bar will appear when the page load , then will hide when no scroll for 4 seconds ,and it will show again while scrolling.
The list items will highlight according to the current active section.
The navigation bar will change the display of the list items from horizontal to vertical according to screen media size.
When click on menu items , will nvigate to the required section smoothly.
```
## Sections
```
The site contains 4 sections .
While scrolling to any section , the current section will highlight .
```
